### Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program
#### Project: MyReads: A Book Tracking App
In the MyReads project, you'll create a web application that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read.

### How to run:
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
* run a production build with `npm run build`
* or visit https://ibastawisi.github.io/myreads to see it in action

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
